    "text": "As an S&C coach, you are probably aware of the story of Milo of Croton. Milo was a Greek athlete in the late 6th century BC who would begin an Olympic training cycle by carrying a newborn calf on his back everyday. Over time the calf would grow bigger and bigger, and Milo would grow stronger and stronger. Eventually he would be carrying a four year old cow on his back and he’d be in peak shape for the Olympics.1 What you probably didn’t know, is that Milo’s strength and conditioning coach was actually plotting his progress in Microsoft Excel. Of course, this was almost 3000 years ago, and just as training methods have progressed, so have our tools for analyzing data. This is why I’ve created this step-by-step guide to take you from an excel spreadsheet containing jump heights (or cow mass measurements) to a beautiful plot built using R, that will take your reports to the next level.1 Also: “He carried the full-grown cow the length of the stadium, then proceeded to kill, roast, and eat it.” You can’t make this stuff up."

A basic understanding of the ggplot2 package will also be helpful.\nMaybe you collect data from force plates but you don’t have a system for analyzing that data. Maybe you use a consumer grade system, like Vald Force Decks or Hawkin Dynamics, but you want to build custom reports outside of those systems. Or maybe you don’t have force plates, but you collect jumps from a jump mat, or an application like MyJump. If any of these describe you, I hope you will find this post useful."

    "section": "Creating the Plot",
    "text": "Creating the Plot\n\n1. Average Daily Jump Height\nWe will start by taking our recent_five data-frame, and creating a plot using the ggplot function.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = TRUE))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we’ve created the basic plot, and we’ve also added our first layer of data; mean jump height for each date. There’s a couple things that bear mentioning here:\n\nI have turned the date into a factor, as I prefer to visualize the jumps as being “equally spaced”, so to speak. It can also be useful to plot the dates chronologically, so you can get an idea of how much time has passed between testing sessions, but this can easily ruin the appearance of the plot, especially if you have long, inconsistent gaps between jump assessments.\nUsing stat_summary allows me to do calculations within the layer of the plot, and saves me from creating more data-frames. The practicality of this should hopefully become increasingly apparent as we add more layers to the plot. In this case, I have asked stat_summary to take the jump height values, group them by date, create mean scores, and display them as size 6 points.\n\nWe now have a basic plot for our primary outcome measure, mean jump height, and our next step is to add maximum jump height. But before we continue adding layers to the plot, I’m going to clean it up a bit with some custom themes.\n\nBrief Intermission: Adding a Theme\n\n\nCode\n#Create a custom theme for my plots and save it as ak_plot_theme\n\nak_plot_theme <- function(..., base_size = 12) {\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = base_size),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_text(color = \"black\",\n                              face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\",\n                             face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, hjust =0.6, vjust = 0.8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16,\n                              color = \"black\",\n                              vjust = 5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\",\n                                 hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8,\n                                face = \"italic\",\n                                color = \"black\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major =  element_line(color = \"#e0e0e0\"),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#ffffff\"),\n    plot.background = element_blank(),\n    panel.border = element_blank())\n}\n\n\nAll the nuances of this theme are beyond the scope of this post, but here’s what you need to know. theme() is a function from the ggplot2 package that allows us to customize the way our plot looks. I have created a function which calls theme() and then sets parameters to define different components of the plots appearance. Saving this theme as a function allows me to add it to any plot as a layer, as seen below. This lets me keep a consistent style whenever I’m creating plots, and saves a lot of typing.\nAdditionally, you can see I’ve customized the x, y, and title labels using labs(). Oh yeah, and I’m going to colour the data points gold using colour = \"D19A2B\".\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Okay, that’s better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Best Daily Jump Height\nNow let’s add a point to show the best (highest) jump our athlete performed each day.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 4, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n    ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\nHere I’ve used stat_summary again, but I’ve switched the function from mean to max, and I’ve decreased the size of the points from 6 to 4, indicating that mean jump height is our primary outcome measure, and maximum jump height is a secondary outcome measure.\nAgain, before moving on, I’m going to make two more aesthetic improvements:\n\nI’ve created a custom function to draw a vertical line connecting the mean and max dots. Stat_summary offers an argument called fun.data which allows you to compute multiple values at once. In this case, I’ve created a function that defines the mean and max values, and asked stat_summary to display a line connecting those two values2. (Figure 4 (a) )\nWe will connect the daily mean scores with a line so we can see changes between daily scores a bit better (Figure 4 (b) ).\n\n2 Honestly, I’m not 100% sure how fun.data communicates with my mean_peak function, but it works, so I’m not asking any questions\n\nCode\n#draw a line between the mean and the max jump height\nmean_peak <- function(x) {\n  data.frame(y = (mean(x) + 0.0001),\n             ymax = max(x),\n             ymin = mean(x))\n}\n\n#Figure 4a: adding vertical lines\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 4, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n#Figure 4b: adding line to connect mean jump heights\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 4, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = 5), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"line\", linewidth = 1, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Vertical lines to join Mean and Max for each day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Trend line for the Mean daily jump height\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Each Jump Performed\nAt this point, we’ve managed to display two different descriptive statistics in one nice clean plot. But like I said, we’re being greedy here and we’d also like to see the height of every single jump. We’ll add this data using a geom_jitter layer, which is basically just a geom_point that let’s us spread the points out, making them a bit easier to see.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 4, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = 5), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"line\", linewidth = 1, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  geom_jitter(aes(y = flight_height_tov), shape = 1, size = 4, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Average performance across all five dates\nLastly, it would be helpful to know how each score compares to the overall mean for this athlete, so we’ll add a horizontal line with the y-intercept set to the overall mean jump height.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Date, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 6, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = Date), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 4, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = 5), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"line\", linewidth = 1, colour = \"#D19A2B\") +\n  geom_jitter(aes(y = flight_height_tov), shape = 1, size = 4, alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(flight_height_tov)), alpha = 0.3, linetype = 2, linewidth = 3) +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates"
