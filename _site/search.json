    "text": "234567\n45678\nIn 2018 I began working with Freestyle skiers.  Well actually, that’s not entirely true.  I began working with Freestyle skiers in 2015. Mogul skiers to be specific. hard working ,traditional yada yada\nBut back to 2018, this is when I started working with Freestyle skiers, perhaps in a more true sense of the word. While this group was undoubtedly composed of some of the most outstanding athletes I’ve ever seen, they were a bit hesitant to welcome someone transitioning from the more serious world of Mogul skiing, to the more laid back world of halfpipe skiing.  It was clear I had a lot of work ahead of me if I wanted to infiltrate the cool kids and spread the gospel of an important warm up.\nSo after a semi-demoralizing camp, where a good day consisted of some mini-band work in the parking lot, and an average day meant strapping up the ski boots and strolling over to the oh-so-comfortable chair lift, I knew I had to do something.\n(Fransz et al. 2015)\n(Tran et al. 2015)\n(Albaladejo-Saura et al. 2021; Alentorn-Geli et al. 2009)\n\nknitr::kable(\n  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n21.4\n6\n258\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n18.7\n8\n360\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n\n\nValiant\n18.1\n6\n225\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo on our next training camp, when we rolled up to the parking lot with no sufficient warm-up area in sight, I pulled the black and yellow bag out of the truck and started assembling what looked to the athletes like a mini-trampoline.  A few of them knew what it was, and were cautiously enthused, and a few others ranged in feeling from skeptical to embarrassed.  \n\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(iris)\nplot(pressure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlbaladejo-Saura, Mario, Raquel Vaquero-Cristobal, Pablo J Marcos-Pardo, and Francisco Esparza-Ros. 2021. “Effect of an Injury Prevention Program on the Lower Limb Stability in Young Volleyball Players.” The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness 61 (7): 943–52. https://doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.20.11477-4.\n\n\nAlentorn-Geli, Eduard, Gregory Myer, Holly Silvers-Granelli, Gonzalo Samitier, Daniel Romero, Cristina Lázaro-Haro, and Ramón Cugat. 2009. “Prevention of Non-Contact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Soccer Players.

    "text": "More recently, however, the sport science community has embraced more advanced tools for data analysis, with R being a popular choice.\n\nWho is this post for?\nMaybe you collect data from force plates but you don’t have a system for analyzing that data. Maybe you don’t have force plates, but you’re able to collect jumps from a jump mat, or an application like MyJump. Or maybe you have access to a consumer grade system, like Vald Force Decks or Hawkin Dynamics, but you want to build custom reports outside of those systems. If any of these describe you, I hope you will be able to learn from this post.\n\n\nGetting Set Up\nThis post does assume that you have R and R Studio installed on your computer, and that you are at least a little bit familiar with coding in R Studio.\nWe will start by installing and loading all necessary packages. I will also source some pre-built functions, which are outside the scope of this post, but which you can find in the github repository for this site.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(bslib)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(thematic)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(gtExtras)\nlibrary(withr)\nlibrary(ggpp)\nlibrary(ggimage)\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\n\nsource(\"~/Dropbox/Data Science/Website/plot_functions.R\")\n\n\n\n\nData Import and Preparation\nFor the purposes of this post, I’ve created a Google sheet which I’ve used to store a simplified output of CMJ results for a fictional athlete. We will begin by importing that data into R Studio using the range_speedread function from the googlesheets4 package, and creating a data-frame called jumps.\n\n\nCode\njumps <- range_speedread(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OYu-AaAK8w36-_JcUsoSuX-BnRnyYozjmn8KQbz-axw/edit?gid=2135526598#gid=2135526598\", sheet = \"Database\") %>%\n  clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(date_ddmmyear = as.Date(date_ddmmyear),\n         date_ddmmyear2 =  (format(date_ddmmyear, \"%b %d, %Y\"))) %>%\n  mutate_at(c(5:69), as.numeric)\n\nrecent_five <- jumps %>%\n  filter(athlete == \"Cassie Sharpe\", activity == \"CMJ\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(date_ddmmyear)) %>%\n  filter(date_ddmmyear %in% unique(date_ddmmyear)[1:5])\n\n\nAnd here is\n\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 3\n   Jump   Date       `Jump Height (cm)`\n   <chr>  <date>                  <dbl>\n 1 Jump 1 2024-07-22               28.9\n 2 Jump 2 2024-07-22               29.2\n 3 Jump 3 2024-07-22               28.8\n 4 Jump 1 2024-07-18               29.1\n 5 Jump 2 2024-07-18               27.4\n 6 Jump 3 2024-07-18               27.3\n 7 Jump 1 2024-06-14               27.7\n 8 Jump 2 2024-06-14               28.2\n 9 Jump 3 2024-06-14               27.7\n10 Jump 1 2024-06-12               29.2\n11 Jump 2 2024-06-12               27.3\n12 Jump 3 2024-06-12               27.8\n13 Jump 4 2024-06-12               26.9\n14 Jump 5 2024-06-12               27.1\n15 Jump 1 2024-06-05               29.3\n16 Jump 2 2024-06-05               28.3\n17 Jump 3 2024-06-05               27.8\n\n\n\n\nWhat am I trying to accomplish with this plot?\nYou will notice that our fictional athlete has performed 3-5 jumps on any given day. You might be interested in only the daily average or daily maximum, but because I’m greedy I am going to try to include as much information in this plot as possible.\nSo I want my plot to clearly show:\n\nAverage Daily Jump Height\nBest Daily Jump\nEach jump performed\nAverage performance across all 5 dates\n\nNow, that’s a lot of information for one plot, so let’s go one step at a time, and see if we can communciate all of this information in a visually pleasing, non-overwhelming manner.\n\n\nCreating the Plot\n\n1. Average Daily Jump Height\nWe will start by taking our recent_five data-frame, and creating a ggplot with the date on the x-axis. We will also use a function called stat_summary to create a mean score for each date.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(date_ddmmyear, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\nSo now we’ve created the basic plot, and we’ve also added our first layer, the mean jump height for each date. Let’s keep going.\n\n\n1b. Quick Intermission for Formatting\nBefore we continue adding layers to the plot, I’m going to clean it up a bit by changing the theme, the axis labels, etc.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(date_ddmmyear, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 4) +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Best Daily Jump Height\nNow we’ve got our basic plot, with a bit of formatting to make it look good, let’s add a point to show the best (highest) jump our athlete performed each day.\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(date_ddmmyear, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 4) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 2) +\n    ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\nGreat, we’ve got both average and maximum on the same plot. I’m just going to make some aesthetic improvements by a) Connecting Mean and Max with a vertical line using a custom stat_summary function (Figure 4 (a) ); and b) connecting the daily Mean scores with a line so we can see changes between daily scores a bit better (Figure 4 (b) ).\n\n\nCode\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(date_ddmmyear, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 4) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 2) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2) +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\nrecent_five %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(date_ddmmyear, ordered = T))) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", size = 4) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = date_ddmmyear), fun = \"max\", geom = \"point\", size = 2) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov), fun.data=mean_peak, geom=\"pointrange\", size = 2) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = flight_height_tov, group = 5), fun = \"mean\", geom = \"line\", linewidth = 1) +\n  ak_plot_theme() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Jump Height (cm)\",\n    title = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Vertical lines to join Mean and Max for each day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Trend line for the Mean daily jump height\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Countermovement jump heights from the last five testing dates\n\n\n\n\n\n3.
