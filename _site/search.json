    "text": "But back to 2018, this is when I started working with Freestyle skiers, perhaps in a more true sense of the word. While this group was undoubtedly composed of some of the most outstanding athletes I’ve ever seen, they were a bit hesitant to welcome someone transitioning from the more serious world of Mogul skiing, to the more laid back world of halfpipe skiing.  It was clear I had a lot of work ahead of me if I wanted to infiltrate the cool kids and spread the gospel of an important warm up.\nSo after a semi-demoralizing camp, where a good day consisted of some mini-band work in the parking lot, and an average day meant strapping up the ski boots and strolling over to the oh-so-comfortable chair lift, I knew I had to do something.\n\nknitr::kable(\n  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n\n\nHornet 4 Drive\n21.4\n6\n258\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n\n\nHornet Sportabout\n18.7\n8\n360\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n\n\nValiant\n18.1\n6\n225\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo on our next training camp, when we rolled up to the parking lot with no sufficient warm-up area in sight, I pulled the black and yellow bag out of the truck and started assembling what looked to the athletes like a mini-trampoline.  A few of them knew what it was, and were cautiously enthused, and a few others ranged in feeling from skeptical to embarrassed.  \n\n\nplot(cars)\nplot(iris)\nplot(pressure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{kates2024,\n  author = {Andrew Kates},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Why Warm up When You Can Play {Spikeball?}},\n  date = {2024-08-13},\n  url = {https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAndrew Kates. 2024. “Why Warm up When You Can Play\nSpikeball?” August 13, 2024. https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/."
