Mogul skiers to be specific. hard working ,traditional yada yada\n\nBut back to 2018, this is when I started working with Freestyle skiers, perhaps in a more true sense of the word. While this group was undoubtedly composed of some of the most outstanding athletes I've ever seen, they were a bit hesitant to welcome someone transitioning from the more serious world of Mogul skiing, to the more laid back world of halfpipe skiing.  It was clear I had a lot of work ahead of me if I wanted to infiltrate the cool kids and spread the gospel of an important warm up.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nSo after a semi-demoralizing camp, where a good day consisted of some mini-band work in the parking lot, and an average day meant strapping up the ski boots and strolling over to the oh-so-comfortable chair lift, I knew I had to do something.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Mount Hood, Summer 2018.](MtHood2018.PNG){fig-align=\"right\" width=\"280\"}\n:::\n:::\n\nSo, on our next training camp, when we rolled up to the parking lot with no sufficient warm-up area in sight, I pulled the black and yellow bag out of the truck and started assembling what looked to the athletes like a mini-trampoline. A few of them knew what it was, and were cautiously enthused, and a few others ranged in feeling from skeptical to embarrassed.\n\n![](spikeball-canada.jpg){.column-screen}\n\nJust for fun, I ran search on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) using only the word \"spikeball\". Look at that, 505 results! @paul2024\n\nSome writing [@paul2024].\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"../../styles.scss","mainfont":"Moderustic","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Why warm up when you can play Spikeball?","description":"Reminiscing on an outside-the-box solution to improve pre-skiing warm up in freestyle skiers","author":[{"name":"Andrew Kates"}],"date":"08-13-2024","categories":["S&C"],"image":"spikeball-canada.jpg","draft":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
