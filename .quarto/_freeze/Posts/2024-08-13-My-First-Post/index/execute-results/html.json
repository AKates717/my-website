Mogul skiers to be specific. hard working ,traditional yada yada\n\nBut back to 2018, this is when I started working with Freestyle skiers, perhaps in a more true sense of the word. While this group was undoubtedly composed of some of the most outstanding athletes I've ever seen, they were a bit hesitant to welcome someone transitioning from the more serious world of Mogul skiing, to the more laid back world of halfpipe skiing.  It was clear I had a lot of work ahead of me if I wanted to infiltrate the cool kids and spread the gospel of an important warm up.\n\nSo after a semi-demoralizing camp, where a good day consisted of some mini-band work in the parking lot, and an average day meant strapping up the ski boots and strolling over to the oh-so-comfortable chair lift, I knew I had to do something.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(\n  mtcars[1:6, 1:10]\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                  |  mpg| cyl| disp|  hp| drat|    wt|  qsec| vs| am| gear|\n|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|---:|----:|-----:|-----:|--:|--:|----:|\n|Mazda RX4         | 21.0|   6|  160| 110| 3.90| 2.620| 16.46|  0|  1|    4|\n|Mazda RX4 Wag     | 21.0|   6|  160| 110| 3.90| 2.875| 17.02|  0|  1|    4|\n|Datsun 710        | 22.8|   4|  108|  93| 3.85| 2.320| 18.61|  1|  1|    4|\n|Hornet 4 Drive    | 21.4|   6|  258| 110| 3.08| 3.215| 19.44|  1|  0|    3|\n|Hornet Sportabout | 18.7|   8|  360| 175| 3.15| 3.440| 17.02|  0|  0|    3|\n|Valiant           | 18.1|   6|  225| 105| 2.76| 3.460| 20.22|  1|  0|    3|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo on our next training camp, when we rolled up to the parking lot with no sufficient warm-up area in sight, I pulled the black and yellow bag out of the truck and started assembling what looked to the athletes like a mini-trampoline.  A few of them knew what it was, and were cautiously enthused, and a few others ranged in feeling from skeptical to embarrassed.  \n\n![](spikeball-canada.jpg){.column-screen}\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen-inset-shaded layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(iris)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
