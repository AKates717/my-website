In 2018 I began working with Freestyle skiers.  Well actually, that's not entirely true.  I began working with Freestyle skiers in 2015. Mogul skiers to be specific. hard working ,traditional yada yada

But back to 2018, this is when I started working with Freestyle skiers, perhaps in a more true sense of the word. While this group was undoubtedly composed of some of the most outstanding athletes I've ever seen, they were a bit hesitant to welcome someone transitioning from the more serious world of Mogul skiing, to the more laid back world of halfpipe skiing.  It was clear I had a lot of work ahead of me if I wanted to infiltrate the cool kids and spread the gospel of an important warm up.

So after a semi-demoralizing camp, where a good day consisted of some mini-band work in the parking lot, and an average day meant strapping up the ski boots and strolling over to the oh-so-comfortable chair lift, I knew I had to do something.

So on our next training camp, when we rolled up to the parking lot with no sufficient warm-up area in sight, I pulled the black and yellow bag out of the truck and started assembling what looked to the athletes like a mini-trampoline.  A few of them knew what it was, and were cautiously enthused, and a few others ranged in feeling from skeptical to embarrassed.
