My name is Andrew Kates. I work as a Sport Scientist at the Canadian Sport Institute Pacific in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. I am also a PhD student in Biomechanics at the University of Victoria. On this website you will find my blog, in which I will write primarily about Strength and Conditioning and practical Data Science for sport.
